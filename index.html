            <h1>Welcome to Eastern Cape Scottish Freemasonry District</h1>
            <p>Discover the rich tradition and values of Scottish Freemasonry in the Eastern Cape</p>
            <blockquote style="max-width:700px;margin:2rem auto 0 auto;padding:1.5rem;background:#145A32;border-left:6px solid #FFD700;color:#FFD700;font-size:1.15rem;line-height:1.7;">
                <p>The Freemason does not seek glory—he seeks truth. He does not walk this path for recognition, nor for wealth. He walks it because it must be walked. He builds, not for himself, but for the generations that come after him.</p>
                <p>If there is darkness, he will bring light. If there is ignorance, he will spread wisdom. If there is hardship, he will endure. He will take the lessons of those before him and carve a legacy upon the stone of time itself.</p>
                <p>And when tested—when the weight of doubt, fear, and pain press upon him—he will take his steps. One by one. Twelve if necessary. Fifty if required. As many as it takes.</p>
                <p>Because a Mason does not yield. He does not falter. He does not fall.</p>
                <p><strong>He rises.</strong></p>
                <p>And in rising, he builds something greater than himself. An unbroken chain, forged by the hands of every brother who ever stood where he stands now.</p>
                <p>A Mason is not simply a man. He is a pillar. And when the storm comes, he does not break—he holds the world upon his shoulders.</p>

            <h2>About the District Grand Lodge of the Eastern Province of the Cape of Good Hope</h2>
            <p><strong>THE DISTRICT GRAND LODGE OF THE EASTERN PROVINCE OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE OF ANCIENT FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS OF SCOTLAND</strong></p>
            <p>The Eastern Cape is a region rich in heritage and natural beauty, known for its adventure, coastline, and wildlife. It is home to the Addo Elephant National Park, Jeffrey's Bay, and notable leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, and Siya Kolisi. The province is a hub for tourism, the motor vehicle industry, and is often referred to as the Adventure Province and Surfing Paradise.</p>
            <p>The history of Scottish Freemasonry in South Africa dates back to 1860, with the first Scottish Constitution lodge established in Cape Town. The growth of Freemasonry in the region led to the formation of the District Grand Lodge of the Eastern Province of the Cape of Good Hope in 1920, to meet the expanding needs of the fraternity. The District has seen a succession of dedicated District Grand Masters, with Bro Wayne Gregory Corney currently serving in this esteemed role since 17th February 2018.</p>

                    <p><strong>Area Served:</strong> Members from as far as Port Elizabeth, covering the Storms River to Gamtoos River region</p>
                    <p><strong>Consecrated:</strong> 4 July 1992 (30 years old)</p>
                    <p><strong>Culture:</strong> A "Country Lodge" and a "Family Lodge" known for harmonies sung after meetings and a close-knit community. Shares premises with Lodge St Francis No. 3086 E.C.</p>

                            <p>A survey in 1991 by Bro. Stief Rootman revealed more than 25 retired Freemasons in the Kouga area without a nearby lodge. After a meeting, it was decided to apply for a Charter from the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The local municipality leased a vacant change room at Aston Bay Beach, Jeffreys Bay, for R600 per year. Three city councilors from different political parties joined, reflecting unity. Once all requirements were met, the lodge was consecrated on 4 July 1992, with members and families organizing and celebrating the event.</p>
                            <p>On the day of consecration, heavy rain forced a venue change to John Lambert Hall in Jeffreys Bay. The banquet, attended by over 300 guests, was the largest Masonic gathering in the Eastern Cape at the time and the first mixed banquet for Scottish lodges in the region. In May 1996, four young men were initiated in one evening, with the ritual led by the late Brother Arthur Smith, aged 80, setting a high standard of proficiency upheld ever since.</p>
                            <p>The lodge has continuously supported the District Grand Lodge, with members frequently serving as Office Bearers. The lodge later relocated to the St. Francis Masonic Centre in Humansdorp and is described as a trendsetter in Masonic progress. Annual Installations continue with enthusiasm, celebrating all brethren past, present, and future.</p>
                            <p><strong>Special Occasions:</strong> Ladies’ Night every month with five Mondays, year-end gatherings, charitable events such as a Valentine’s Tea and golf day (supporting Buffelsfontein Retirement Village in Port Elizabeth).</p>
                            <p><strong>Current Reigning Master:</strong> Bro. Craig Leonard John Jessop</p>
                            <p><strong>Masters Who Became DGM’s:</strong> Founding members BB D. Levy, N. Randell, and A. Jacobs; honorary members include past DGM’s BB William Basson, Donald Dye, Wayne Harvey, and Immediate Past Grand Master Mason, Bro Charles Iain Robert Wolridge Gordon of Esselmont.</p>

                            <p>Consecrated in 1880, Lodge St Andrew No. 651 S.C. was established by 17 founding members from a wide range of local and Scottish lodges, including Albany Lodge No. 389EC, St John's Lodge No. 828EC, Pt Paul's Lodge No. 989EC, and several Scottish lodges. The first Right Worshipful Master was Bro William Young, installed by Bro Alex Duncan, RWM of Lodge Kaffrarian Celtic No. 631.</p>
                            <p>Known as the "City of Saints" lodge, it has a deep-rooted connection to both local and international Freemasonry, emphasizing tradition, unity, and continuity. Notable past RWMs include Bro Alex Will and his son AH Will, Bro JC Rae (compiler of “The Tyler of 651”), Bros WE McLeod and S Pudifin (SA Bowls champions), Bro Lt-Col. Dr FA Saunders (first RW District Grand Master), Bro JE Miller (lawn bowler), and Bro EW Stoyell (lodge historian).</p>
                            <p>The Second Temple still exists in Grahamstown (now Makhanda), but is no longer used for Masonic activity. The lodge now meets in the Masonic Complex, Hill Street, Makhanda, and is a shareholder in the Grahamstown Masonic Temple Company (Pty) Ltd. Bro Bl Borman (PM) was among the first directors of the Company. At the Consecration Meeting of Lodge Caledonia No. 796 in 1895, most Officers were from Lodge 651.</p>
                            <p>Lodge 651 serves as the Administrative seat of the District, hosting lectures and educational activities at all meetings. Meetings are held quarterly in Makhanda on the 4th Saturday in February, May, August, and November (Installation in November). The lodge experienced a quiet period in the mid-2000s but now enjoys robust membership, including many Past and current RW District Grand Masters and other distinguished brethren. The lodge will celebrate its 150th year in 2030.</p>

                            <p>The consecration lasted from midday until 23h00, reflecting a tradition of harmony that continues today. R.W. Bro. Rice, a founding Master, began his Masonic journey in St Andrews Lodge No. 651 S.C. in 1892, founded Caledonia in 1893, and was installed as Master in 1894. He served as RWM twice, installed the first RWM of Lodge Bon Accord, conducted consecrations for Caledonia and Victoria, and set a record with seven sons initiated into Caledonia. He also became the first Master of Lodge Macabean No. 1000 and was awarded Grand Steward rank by the Grand Lodge of Scotland.</p>
                            <p>Caledonia produced leaders such as Bro. Donald Dye (District Grand Master, 8 years), Bro. Will Basson (5 years), and Bro. Craig Jessop (current DGM designate). The lodge sold its Central premises and joined Bon Accord in North End, with its building serving as a home for Freemasonry in the Eastern Cape.</p>
                            <p>Caledonia is known for excellent workings, harmonies, and a mix of senior and young brethren. Its culture balances hard work with social events and pioneering charitable initiatives, including scholarships. Notably, Bro. Alistair Wilson, District Grand Piper, is celebrated for his musical talent.</p>

                            <p>Founded in 1877, not the first in Queenstown (Star of the East, 1862). First meeting: 14 March 1878. Early leadership included RWM Bro George Smyth, WSW Bro Charles Howse, and WJW Bro JG Brimner. The lodge grew rapidly, with five initiates at its first meeting and a tradition of leadership and expansion.</p>
                            <p>St Andrews built its own hall in Porter Street (1883), expanded in 1903 and 1955, and commemorates Bro Walter Baines, a stonemason and 50-year member. The Amity Royal Arch Chapter predates the lodge (1869) and remains active.</p>
                            <p>The lodge has never been dormant, surviving wars and depressions, and is the oldest Scottish Constitution lodge in the District and fifth oldest in Africa. St Andrews is renowned for its charitable work, musical heritage (notably William Coulson Tregarthen), and outreach programs. In 2018, it moved to Port Elizabeth and held its Installation at Bon Accord Masonic Complex.</p>

                            <p>Founded in 1896, first meeting at Old Fellows Hall, later Gaiety Theater. Grew steadily, contributing to Freemasonry and East London’s development. Early leadership included Bro. Brown (first RWM), Wor. Bro. Currin, and Bro. S.G. Pound. The lodge built and moved between several halls, with major expansions and upgrades (MacLean Street, Buffalo Street, Croydon Road, and finally Gonubie in 2022).</p>
                            <p>Thistle is known for its resilience, adapting through wars, financial challenges, and relocations. The lodge has a tradition of strong leadership (including Bro. Randall, DGM in the 1970s), ritual excellence, and brotherhood. Its history includes significant charitable work and a commitment to Scottish Masonic tradition.</p>

                            <p>Founded in 1878 with strong military ties, many members served in the 9th Frontier War. Alex Duncan was the first RWM (1878–1879), and the lodge helped install the first RWM of St Andrews No. 651 SC in 1880 after a 122 km horseback journey. Kaffrarian Celtic is the second-oldest Scottish lodge in the District.</p>
                            <p>The lodge survived a fire in 1998, with the Volume of Sacred Law saved. It relocated to the Bramble Masonic Complex in Gonubie, East London. Kaffrarian Celtic is known for fundraising (including golf days), adherence to Scottish customs, and fostering inter-constitutional respect.</p>
